@article{2000,
	Abstract = {This paper defines and studies a new class of non-stationary random processes constructed from discrete non-decimated wavelets which generalizes the Cram{\'e}r (Fourier) representation of stationary time series. We define an evolutionary wavelet spectrum (EWS) which quantifies how process power varies locally over time and scale. We show how the EWS may be rigorously estimated by a smoothed wavelet periodogram and how both these quantities may be inverted to provide an estimable time-localized autocovariance. We illustrate our theory with a pedagogical example based on discrete non-decimated Haar wavelets and also a real medical time series example.},

	Abstract = {We develop a technique for using monostatic, electronically steerable
	incoherent scatter radar (ISR) to generate 2-D estimates of F region
	flow fields. Tikhonov regularization is used to achieve robustness
	in the presence of spatial variation. The regularization functional
	imposes partial incompressibility on the medium and is therefore
	physically justified. Although the estimator has difficulty resolving
	sharp discontinuities, it performs well in regions of uniform flow.
	In order to characterize the effect of the regularization parameter,
	we test the performance of the operator in three simulated scenarios.
	We then analyze data from an experiment on the Poker Flat ISR. The
	experimental results are validated against coregistered all-sky optical
	data and are found to be mostly consistent with these independent
	measurements. Namely, the radar-derived estimates show a reduction
	of ion flow wherever the optical data indicates an auroral enhancement.
	The estimated flow is directed parallel to an arc boundary, consistent
	with an electric field directed toward the arc.},

	Abstract = {A theory is developed which describes the scattering of radio waves
	by the random thermal fluctuations of electron density in a collision-free
	plasma. The frequency spectrum, as well as the amplitude, of the
	scattered radiation is calculated. Particular attention is paid to
	the part of the spectrum which corresponds to small Doppler shifts,
	this being the region of greatest significance in connexion with
	the phenomenon of incoherent scattering from the ionosphere. The
	calculations are based on a generalized version of Nyquist's noise
	theorem, and they lead to the following conclusions: (1) The mean
	scattering cross-section for the ionosphere is equal to that which
	would exist if each of the electrons scattered independently with
	a cross-section of one-half the classical Thomson cross-section.
	(2) The mean Doppler broadening of the scattered signal corresponds
	roughly to the speed of the ions rather than to that of the electrons.
	(3) The spectral shape of this signal is not Gaussian. There is a
	mild maximum in the spectrum away from the central frequency, as
	can be seen in figure 1. (4) Plasma resonance effects contribute
	only negligibly to the scattering for frequencies currently of interest.},

	Abstract = {Single-pulse and double-pulse methods for measuring the cross-correlation
	(two polarizations transmitted and received) or auto-correlation
	(one polarization only) function of the scattered signal are described.
	The statistical errors associated with various forms of multi-bit
	(no quantization errors in the sampling process), one-bit, and hybrid
	estimators of the correlation function are calculated and compared,
	both for large and small signal-to-noise ratios. Roughly speaking,
	when the signal correlation is small, the hybrid estimators require
	\&{\#}960;/2 and the one-bit \&{\#}960;2/4 times as many independent
	samples as the multi-bit estimators to achieve the same statistical
	accuracy, but this disadvantage is often more than compensated for
	by an increase in the effective sampling rate. When the correlation
	is 0.5 or more, there may be a substantial difference between estimators
	of the same class (multi-bit, for example). Systematic distortions
	of the correlation function and limitations on resolution associated
	with the finite receiver bandwidth and transmitted pulse length are
	calculated. The effect of a refractive index slightly less than unity

@article{farleydougherty:ISR2,
	Abstract = {A general expression for the frequency spectrum of radio waves scattered
	by the random thermal fluctuations of electron density in a plasma
	in a magnetic field is derived. The derivation is based on the generalized
	Nyquist noise theorem used in part I. The exact result is then simplified
	by means of an approximation which amounts to assuming the velocity
	of light to be infinite. It is shown that this approximation is quite
	adequate for ionospheric applications of the theory. Next it is proved,
	without appealing to any approximation, that the magnetic field can
	never alter the total scattered signal power: it can only redistribute
	this power over the spectrum. Finally, the detailed shape of the
	frequency spectrum of the scattered signal is examined. Analytic
	expressions are given for certain limiting cases, but for the cases
	of most interest, numerical methods must be used. The results of
	some numerical calculations are shown in figures 1 and 2. From these
	results, it can be seen that the magnetic field has a significant
	effect on the shape of the spectrum only if the incident radio beam
	is very nearly orthogonal to the magnetic lines of force. For example,
	for an operating frequency of 40 Mc/s, no significant magnetic effect
	is observed even when the beam is within 5? of orthogonality. As
	this angle is decreased further, however, the spectrum rapidly begins
	to develop spikes at Doppler shifts which are approximate multiples
	of the ion gyro-frequency. These spikes are quite pronounced when
	the beam is 2? from orthogonality. At higher operating frequencies,
	the beam must be proportionally closer to orthogonality to achieve
	the same effect.},

	the time delay at which the autocorrelation function of the scattering

	simultaneously, along with any available a priori information on
	ionospheric and system parameters such as ionosonde and plasma-line
	estimates of f 0 F 2. The analysis yields spline function estimates
	of height-varying ionospheric parameter profiles. The effect of the
	full two-dimensional (range-lag) radar ambiguity function is included
	in this analysis. Millstone Hill single-pulse lag profile data are
	presented and analyzed and the new technique is shown to produce

@article{semeter:plasmatransport2012,
	Abstract = {A detailed study of the effects of auroral current systems on thermal
	ionospheric plasma transport and loss is conducted using a new ionospheric
	model. The mathematical formulation of the model is a variation on
	the 5-moment approximation which describes the temporal evolution
	of density, drift, and temperature for five different ion species
	in two spatial dimensions. The fluid system is closed through a 2-D
	electrostatic treatment of the auroral currents. This model is used
	to examine the interplay between ion heating, perpendicular transport,
	molecular ion generation, and type-1 ion upflows in a self-consistent
	way for the first time. Simulations confirm that the depletion of
	E-region plasma due to current closure occurs on extremely fast time
	scales (5\&{\#}8211;30 s), and that it is dependent on current system
	scale size. Near the F-region peak, the loss is mostly due to enhanced
	recombination from the conversion of the plasma to molecular ions.
	The F-region loss process is fairly slow (120\&{\#}8211;300 s) by
	comparison to lower altitude processes and is highly electric field
	dependent. On similar time scales, transient ion upflows from frictional
	heating move plasma from the near topside ionosphere (\&{\#}8764;500
	km) to higher regions, leaving depletions and enhancing plasma densities
	at very high altitudes. Results indicate the existence of large molecular
	ion upflows near the F-region peak and may shed some light on ionospheric
	source regions for outflowing molecular ions. Neutral atmospheric
	winds and densities are also shown to play an important role in modulating
	molecular ion densities, frictional heating, and currents.},
